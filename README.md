This repository represents my 5 month journey with Baltic Institute of Technologies in Full Stack programming.

We started with HTML, CSS and then gradually included JavaScript language. Later we were introduced to Bootstrap and React.js.
After we got familiar with React.js we took on PHP and MySQL. Laravel was the last thing we learned.
